                    <p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Defective Return</h4>
                    <p>
                        Defective items claimed need to be returned in original packaging, or it will be identified as misuse defect. No credit will be issued. We will only issue in-house credit for such damaged returns.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Lost - Shipments and Claims</h4>
                    <p>
                        If the shipping company loses your package during or after picking it up from our shipping facilities, which happens very rarely, it is the fault and responsibility of the shipping company, not Academy Fence Company. 
                        <br>There will be two options:
                        <ol>
                            <li>We provide you the claim and instructions and once this is settled, we send you the purchased items at no additional cost to you, the customer. This could take several weeks.</li>
                            <li>You repurchase the order. We reship the order and reimburse your original "lost" shipment when it has been "settled" with the shipping company.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        All items are double inspected before we ship out with a shipping carrier to ensure the items are in good condition. If you find the item or package is damaged you must report this to the shipping carrier's driver immediately so the driver will have the record of your claim. Customer will have to contact carrier's claim department to file a claim for any lost or damaged items...

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Refusals or Undeliverable Orders</h4>
                    <p>
                        Customer pays a 30% processing & restocking fee as well as shipping costs from us to you and back to us as a result of refusals or undeliverable.
                    </p>
